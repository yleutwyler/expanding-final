    <div class="poem">

      <p>For the interview portion of this project, I conducted user testing to gather data by having the interviewee use audio descriptions for clips from each of the three genres and give me feedback such as, what they liked/didn’t like, what worked/didn’t work, what could be improved. Additionally, I found two experts from the field, one being Lyman Clayborn, the Library Manager at The New York Public Library and the other being Chancey Fleet, the assistive technology coordinator for the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library at New York Public Library. As Ms. Fleet is legally blind, she uses audio descriptions on a daily basis and was able to provide me with extensive information I had not thought of or heard in prior research.</p>

      <p>I decided to reach out to Lyman Clayborn because I felt that even if he could not personally help me with this particular topic, he would certainly be the person to know who could, and I was right. We spoke for nearly half an hour, and while he recommended I talk to Chancey Fleet, he brought up concepts I had not previously thought of.</p>

      <p> While Mr. Clayborn did not directly focus on audio descriptions, at the NYPL he spent a lot of time working with audio books so I decided to ask some of the questions I had scripted to ask my user-testing group to Mr. Clayborn and hear the feedback he has gotten from others on the audio books the NYPL offers. While the NYPL has a very high level of quality audio books and has numerous devices which allow the user to adjust everything from volume to tone altering bass and treble I had not thought about how audio books or audio descriptions done in different accents could bother people, or even being done by a male voice versus a female voice. </p>  

      <p> This was a new concept introduced to me by Mr. Clayborn as he has received feedback from users about liking male audio books of female ones sometimes just because the voice is clearer or deeper but other times because they simply cannot make out the high decibel female voice dispute changing intonations. Another aspect of that would be people who preferred British accents over American accents, something I was able to relate to as I have always enjoyed watching documentaries with a British narrator as opposed to an American one due to personal preference as my mother speaks with a British accent so growing up that was easier to understand and was more comforting to me. </p>

      <p>When I asked Chancey Fleet, a legally blind and daily user of audio descriptions on whether or not she felt audio descriptions varied depending on the genre she presented me with a new idea I hadn’t thought of. She said, “sure, the effectiveness of audio descriptions does vary, and that depends on what is being audio described. For example, if you are watching a drama and the audio description describes something right before it happens you can react at a different moment than the rest of the audience which can be kind of odd. Also, in drama, there can be terms and phrases which can be imprecise and distract as well as the possibility for pivotal details to be perhaps left out. For example in the thriller/drama film released in 1999, The Sixth Sense, there’s a red doorknob that you keep seeing and for some reason it's important. Had the audio descriptors left out that detail which one wouldn’t immediately know is a critical detail, the user would miss out on something. For dramas and comedies, the emotional content is really valuable, and conciseness of the audio descriptions is crucial.” </p>

          <p class="caption">The red doorknob from The Sixth Sense.</p>

      <p>“On the other hand, when doing audio descriptions for science, technology and engineering and mathematics content you really need to be precise and make sure you’re delivering information which really captures what’s happening on screen. For example, if a graph is being shown on screen you really need to know the basic things about that chart. If you’re looking at an animation of an atom that needs to be described in a certain way using scientific terms, more attention to detail must be paid. However, as with anything it can be done well and done badly.”</p>

      <p> When asking her about animation and why she felt the users I tested found the audio descriptions to be better for animation she theorizes that it could perhaps be because “animation is so stylized to begin with” though she thinks audio descriptions for non-fiction work is generally more precise as “word choice and naturalness in dialogue including pauses makes for better descriptions”. </p>

          <p class="caption">A still from the movie Frozen which was the animation portion of this assignment in its user-testing phase.</p>
      </div>

      <p> The clip I used for my user testing for animation was from the movie Frozen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7j4_aP8dWA). It proved to be very successful in my user testing. Unfortunately, the two other clips I used, one a news clip and the other a documentary clip, were on YouTube and have been removed, likely a result of copywrite infringement as the audio descriptions were not done by the companies directly but by other users.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, she states that while all the aspects she spoke about in terms of pauses in dialogue and attention to small detail are important, “I wouldn’t say there’s one form that lends itself more to audio descriptions than others,” and that it really just depends on the overall quality of the audio descriptions to which she usually points people to the book, The Visual Made Verbal, which is a textbook for aspiring audio describers. Another great program she recommends is www.youdescribe.org, which allows you to describe YouTube videos.</p>
