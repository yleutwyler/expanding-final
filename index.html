      <p> My final project focuses on analyzing the difference in the effectiveness of audio descriptions when used for different genres (documentary, news, animation). For the interview portion of this project, I conducted user testing to gather data by having the interviewee use audio descriptions for clips from each of the three genres and give me feedback such as, what they liked/didn’t like, what worked/didn’t work, what could be improved. Additionally, I found two experts from the field, one being Lyman Clayborn, the Library Manager at The New York Public Library and the other being Chancey Fleet, the assistive technology coordinator for the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library at New York Public Library. As Ms. Fleet is legally blind, she uses audio descriptions on a daily basis and was able to provide me with extensive information I had not thought of or heard in prior research. </p>

      <p> The purpose of my project is to compare and contrast audio descriptions used in different genres of media (documentary, news, and animation) and whether or not their effectiveness varies. For example, are audio descriptions in the news more precise than in children’s animation because there is less to describe? The problem I am addressing is effectiveness. The main issues the conclusion of my project addresses are clarity and ease in understanding the information while offering feedback on how to improve based on the data I get from interviews.  </p>

      <p>The book Audio Description: New perspectives illustrated, edited by Anna Maszerowska, Anna Matamala, and Pilar Orero analyzed audio descriptions in different movies such as Inglorious Bastards and judged its quality based on the combination of languages used in the film, and its impact on cultural references and nonverbal features on the main turning points in the movie's development. It then tested “different audiovisual translation modes and the corresponding audio description possibilities and strategies” (6). The book stated that it is important to analyze different film genres and styles when assessing audio descriptions, and that is exactly what I did in this project. </p>

      <p>Some constraints of my project would be that I have only interviewed a small handful of people, and the questions I am asking are mostly subjective though this is standard for any user testing. I have used my results, and sources cited in the context colophon and decided against coming to any definite conclusion while instead talking more loosely about their effectiveness overall. I do not feel I had enough data to conclude that one genre is significantly better than another. </p>

      <p> I was not the only person to look into audio descriptions and find that some genres may be easier or harder than another to describe. While the study, The Language System of Audio Description: An Investigation as a Discursive Process, focuses mostly on language it also asked “all the simple questions such as whether or not adding audio descriptions makes a difference but also analyzes how different genres such as mysteries and musicals are harder for the describers and may cause some challenges because of that.” </p>
